Milestones
----------

* Flesh out the "expected" project in `template/expected`.  Use Molt as the
  model project and refactor Molt when I see that improvements can be made.

Tasks
-----

* Create issue that upload also registers when uploading a version for the
  first time.
* Get --run-tests running one substantive test.
* Remove the project_types/default after checking for useful code.
* Look into how to download developer-specific dependencies.

* Switch config file from .json to .yaml.
* Add the ability to execute a script after rendering.
