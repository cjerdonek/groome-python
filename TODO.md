TODO

Milestones
----------

* Flesh out the "expected" project in `template/expected`.  Use Molt as the
  model project and refactor Molt when I see that improvements can be made.

Tasks

* Make a GitHub project for the expected directory for Groome-Python:
  (and link to groome-python in the URL)
* Get --run-tests running one substantive test.
* Stub out use of argparse and document.
* Remove the project_types/default after checking for useful code.
* Stub out README.
* Stub out HISTORY.
* Stub out a command-line script (which can later include a run-test command).
* Stub out TODO.
* Stub out image.
* Stub out setup.py.
* Think about what should go in pizza_setup/ and what should go in a
  separate tools/ directory (or library).
